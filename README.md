## weatherForecast

This project was developed for a summer internship application challenge. 

The objective of the project was to develop a Single Page Application with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org).

The requested features were:
 - [X] Use of Weather Forecast API;
 - [X] [Prototype](https://dribbble.com/shots/862354-Mayan-Forecast)
 
 Additional Features:
 - [X] Search for cities and returned their location with Google Maps API;
 
 ## Setup
 
 Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

 ## Extra: Learning React
 
 As boilerplate I used the following project:

 And learned the basics from [Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)
